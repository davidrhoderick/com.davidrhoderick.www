	<h2>artist statement</h2>
	
	<p>My work facilitates the interface between organic life and technology. Whether in digital media production or in robotic and automated systems, the pieces result in visceral experiences that enhance the connection between consciousness, nature, and machines. I focus on the functionality of technology that allows for programmatic composition and multidimensional capture. My use of technology often extends the reach of human beings, accomplishing tasks that only it is able to, like measuring temperature reliably at distance or automating a “sun” for plant growth.</p>

	<p>The roots of my thesis lie in music; the connection between humans and precise and accurate control over the phenomenon of sound. I explored unconventional use of effects pedals as instruments, which piqued an interest in the electrical circuits that went into them. Along with an education in programming and media manipulation, the use of autonomous technology and media collection in the process of my work comes naturally. However, I am also hyper-aware of the appearance of technology in digital work today and try to minimize it’s footprint. I fashion my work in a minimalist and functionalist aesthetic. Yet, don’t forget to look at it with a sense of play and passion. It is, after all, art.</p>
